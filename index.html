     		<p class="date">February 14, 2025</p>
      	<p>Amazing! I would not have watched this movie if I had known the plot beforehand, but I'm so glad I did. My favorite scene was Rudy having dinner with Haley's family. Kudos to the entire crew!</p>

      <p>Another movie that I would not have watched if I knew the plot beforehand. Very interesting spin on the classic meeting the in-laws over the holidays.</p>

      <h2>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</h2>
      <p class="date">February 28, 2025</p>
      <p>Our mom knows this movie bar for bar. Hard to believe the whole thing takes place over ~15 days. I wonder if Ben gets his $300 back.</p>

      <h2>Mrs. Doubtfire</h2>
      <p class="date">February 28, 2025</p>
      <p>The way Mrs. Doubtfire takes care of the home and stays in character (for the most part) is absolutely delightful. Dancing while vacuuming/sweeping looks so fun. Maybe I should do that more often. Iâ€™m always so calculated while doing it so itâ€™ll be different. On a separate note, Mrs. Doubtfireâ€™s television show reminds me of Tootsie (should I rewatch Tootsie?)</p>

        My eyes adored you ðŸŽ¶ <br>
        Can't take my eyes off of you~ (my favorite one!) <br>
        I'm always glad to watch a movie featuring NJ. I knew a lot of their songs, but I didn't know they were the ones singing them.</p>

      <h2>The Women</h2>
      <p class="date">March 13, 2025</p>
      <p>A longform ad for Dove and the Real Beauty Campaign. It was interesting to watch it unfold that the main cast is all women, even though Stephen is often discussed.</p>

      <h2>Beetlejuice</h2>
      <p class="date">March 28, 2025</p>
      <p>Our cousin is going to perform this in a play at her school, so I decided to watch the film to understand it. Tim Burtonâ€™s works are always a work of art and this is no different.</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s the second film of the night with Winona Ryder. I think this is my favorite Adam Sandler film so far. Now I want to eat pizza and a Wendyâ€™s Frosty.</p>
